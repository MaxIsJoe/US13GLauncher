# US13GLauncher
 An unoffical launcher created for UnityStation. Made in Godot.

### Why Make this?
I don't believe that the current implementation of stationhub is reliable as it uses a weird library to get it working and there is no one who understands it who can actively maintain it.

Godot has the advantages of the ease of use, easy-to-maintain and understand and anyone can get into it quite quickly. Plus we get dedicated UI tools to make our lives easier if we ever decide to make this launcher look sexy and appealing.

### Plans for the future

- Allow for multiple APIs
- Install Manager
- Changelog section for all server forks
- News section
- Settings for customizing the launcher to your liking
- 1 to 1 parity with the old launcher


### Possible things to consider 

- Move the project to C#
- Sandboxing for offical servers
- Account Manager (having more than one account and switching between them)

### Creator notes
This is a small side project of mine, I welcome anyone to try to contribute to it.
